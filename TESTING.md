Testing was ongoing throughout the entire process. Chrome developer tools was used whilst building to find and troubleshoot any issues.

I have analysed each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure the responsiveness of all pages on different screen sizes.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [index.html] - Passed, no errors or warnings to show.
* [signup.html] - Passed, no errors or warnings to show.
* [feedback.html] - Passed, no errors or warnings to show.
* [style.css] - Passed, no errors or warnings to show.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Results

All pages achieved a minimum of 92 for best practices, and an average of 88 for performance.

### JSHint

I used JSHint to evaluate the JavaScript Code.

### Results

It was found that one variable was undefined (username) resulting in errors on the signup page, this has since been resolved.

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The initial banner text was clear on some pages but difficult to read against the background on others | By adding a shadow the text had better readability  |
| 2 | When adding media queries to my index page the footer was sitting on top of the text content | I realised this was due to the text content being larger than the div container, by resizing the div container I solved this |
| 3 | Initially when moving through pages on the navigation bar the underline did not move to the relvent page | By ensuring all pages were set to "active" I solved this issue. |
